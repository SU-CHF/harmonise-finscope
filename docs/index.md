# FinScope Harmonisation
{: .fs-9 }

Consistent, researcher-friendly indicators assembled from the FinScope Consumer South Africa surveys.
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }

Start with the setup guide, follow the end-to-end workflow, and lean on the mapping notes as you extend the project to new waves.

## Why harmonise?
- Compare financial inclusion trends across survey years with shared definitions.
- Preserve the detailed question wording that underpins each indicator.
- Produce wide and long analytical tables for downstream econometric work.
