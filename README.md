# Harmonise Finscope 

This repository’s goal is to harmonise repeated-cross-sectional waves of the FinScope Consumer South Africa survey into a consistent time-series of key indicators.  
The aim is to enable trend analysis of financial inclusion, service usage, livelihood measures and other consumer-financial behaviours in South Africa through time.
